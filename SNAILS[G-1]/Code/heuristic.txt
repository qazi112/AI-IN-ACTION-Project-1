Heuristic()
===========
The main purpose of heuristic function is to indicate, whether a particular move is in
the right direction or not. Due to the big size of board, it is not feasible to generate 
all possible children of the board and figure out the best move for AI agent. Therefore,
‘heursitic()’ function predicts the best possible move without processing all possibilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation
===============
This function implements three main techniques to figure out the best possible move.
For this purpose, a variable “winningChances” is initialized. These techniques will add
some weight to this variable if the following conditions are fulfilled.

1) First Condition: Calculate the number of visited boxes by AI Agent and add them to
the variable ‘winnigChances’.

2) Second Condition: Calculate the number of empty boxes around the current position
of AI Agent. If the agent is going towards a direction where there are a lot of empty
boxes, then it means it is going in the right direction. The number of empty boxes will
be added to the variable ‘winnigChances’

3) Third Condition: Check whether Agent’s current position is in the central area of
board. If it is so, then a constant e.g. 10 will be added to the variable ‘winnigChances’.
The reason behind is that central area increases the chances to cover more empty
boxes. Here center is not a single point but it is a range of boxes around center box
if the current position of agent is in that range it means it is going toward center.
